                Sadman Soumik is a front-end developer specializing in UX/UI designs â€“ his web developer portfolio is an
                excellent representation of his expertise.
                Rather than using multiple website layouts, he provides all the essential information on a single page,
                from
                his work to contact details. It is a great example of how to showcase your skills and experience in a
                minimalist way.
